                            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Vehicle repair shops often struggle with fragmented workflows across various departments,
                                from customer management to inventory tracking and payroll. To streamline operations,
                                reduce inefficiencies, and improve customer experience, a digital solution was required
                                that could manage everything from appointments to inventory, service scheduling, and
                                salesâ€”all within a single integrated system.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <!-- Solution Section -->
                            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                            <p>We developed an all-in-one platform, E-Bengkel, to support a wide range of automotive
